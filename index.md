      <p>Responsible product development <strong>acknowledges the great power</strong> digital products have over peopleâ€™s lives, the <strong>hidden social and environmental costs</strong> of digital products, and <strong>actively seeks better solutions</strong> for people and the planet.</p>
      <p class="block-subtitle">Responsible product development values:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>the wellbeing of people and the planet</strong> <em>over</em> short-term revenue and vanity metrics,</li>
        <li><strong>sustainable business models</strong> <em>over</em> unsustainable growth,</li>
        <li><strong>building products that are good for people and the planet</strong> <em>over</em> building products just because you can,</li>
        <li><strong>taking personal responsibility</strong> <em> over</em> blaming the system,</li>
        <li><strong>changing products</strong> <em>over</em> trying to justify harmful product decisions,</li>
        <li><strong>taking the climate crisis seriously</strong> <em>over</em> greenwashing,</li>
        <li><strong>subtractive solutions and doing more with less</strong> <em>over</em> adding unnecessary complexity,</li>
        <li><strong>taking time to consider the direct and indirect effects of product decisions</strong> <em>over</em> moving fast and breaking things.</li>
