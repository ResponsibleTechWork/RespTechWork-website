# Contributing

We welcome contributions to this project. Please follow our code of conduct (CODE_OF_CONDUCT).

To contribute you will need to fork the project. Thereafter follow the set up instructions in the README file. 

## Opening an issue

We recommend opening an issue for the following situations:

* Reporting an error you canâ€™t solve yourself
* Discussing a high-level topic or idea (for example, community, vision or policies)
* Proposing a new feature or other project idea

This list is taken from [Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#how-to-submit-a-contribution).

If you decide to tackle an issue yourself, these are the steps you'll need to take to make a pull request.

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone your fork
3. Create a local branch
4. Run the project
5. Make your changes, and test them by running the site locally
6. Add the changes you made in the working directory to the staging area
7. Commit your changes, together with a short description, and referencing any related issues 
8. Push your changes to your fork
9. Create a pull request from your fork to the original, upstream project
10. Receive feedback, iterate as necessary
11. Once we have accepted your pull request, we will merge your changes into the project main branch

## Forking the repository

Before contributing to the project, create a fork and clone it locally. If you're not sure how to do this, Kent C. Dodds has a helpful [video guide to forking and cloning a git repository](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-how-to-fork-and-clone-a-github-repository).

GitHub has this [text-only guide to forking a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).

## Creating a pull request

Once you have the project running locally, create a new branch for the issue you want to work on. Remember to regularly pull changes from "upstream" to reduce the likelihood of merge conflicts.

To make a pull request, we recommend clicking the **Compare & pull request** button in GitHub. If this is no longer visible (it disappears after an hour or so), click the **New pull request** button and select the **compare across forks** link. Set the head repository (head fork) to your fork, and the branch that you are comparing to the branch you just pushed.

The default message of the pull request is the message you added to your commit. Please add as much information as you can to the body of the request; you cannot be too verbose!

If any of this is unclear, Ken C. Dodds has another useful how-to video, [how to create a pull request on github](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-how-to-create-a-pull-request-on-github).
