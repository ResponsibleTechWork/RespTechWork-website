    title: Why change?
    content: >-
        Tech companies can no longer afford to move fast and break things. It's time for us to factor in the **social and planetary costs of product innovation and development**.


        We recognize that thinking about ethics, diversity, inclusivity, and sustainability on top of existing business needs is hard. We aim to reduce the cost (and the pain) of adopting a more responsible approach to product innovation and development by proposing **easy-to-implement updates of processes we're already familiar with**.
