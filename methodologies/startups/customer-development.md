description: The Customer Development Process helps startups find their initial business model, which makes it a great methodology for introducing responsible thinking in the earliest stages of a company.

Another well-known startup methodology is the **Customer Development Model**, described in [The Startup Owner's Manual](https://www.amazon.com/Startup-Owners-Manual-Step-Step/dp/1119690684/) by Steve Blank and Bob Dorf.

The model's **Customer Development Process** includes four basic steps. The first two steps of the process (*Customer discovery* and *Customer validation*) focus on **searching** for a business model, while the next two steps (*Customer creation* and *Company building*) focus on **executing** the business model from the initial two steps.

The initial *customer discovery* step sets the tone for all further business activities of the startup, so we'll primarily focus on this step of the process.


## Customer Discovery

The **customer discovery step** shares many similarities with the [Lean Startup methodology](/methodologies/startups/the-lean-startup.html). As [The Startup Owner's Manual](https://www.amazon.com/Startup-Owners-Manual-Step-Step/dp/1119690684/) describes it,  *"customer discovery first captures the founders' vision and turns it into a series of business model hypotheses."* In other words, a startup has to identify the assumptions behind its business model, which is usually presented on a **business model canvas**. The startup can also use the business model canvas as a **scorecard of hypotheses** throughout the process.

Additionally, the customer discovery step *"(...) develops a plan to test customer reactions to those hypotheses and turn them into facts."* The customer discovery step is iterative, which means that a startup can repeat it as often as needed until the hypotheses are validated. If a hypothesis is proven wrong, the startup can pivot into a new direction during this step.

Given the similarities with the [Lean Startup methodology](/methodologies/startups/the-lean-startup.html), we can also apply the changes proposed in the previous section to the **customer discovery process**:

- using an **[improved business model canvas](/tools/business/business-model-canvases/)** that exposes environmental & social costs and assumptions when defining the business model, 
- building **low-tech and low-impact minimum viable products (MVPs)** to test the hypotheses,
- using **responsible metrics**, paying attention to people's well-being and the product's carbon footprint when evaluating solutions, 
- testing the **impact hypothesis** as early as possible.
