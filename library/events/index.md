*** 

We invite you to use the library for your own conversations on responsible tech. Please keep in mind that we're currently using the free hosted version of WorkAdventure with a limit of 15 concurrent users and that bubble zones are limited to a maximum of 4 people. 

If you'd like to organize an event in the Library, please send us an email at **{{ site.email }}**. We can set up a larger Jitsi meet area in the Library to support a larger event.
